This repository is a fork of git://github.com/Pihro/lof-tmwa-client-data.git,
which contains client-side data for running a game based on The Mana World
called Land of Fire.

Technically speaking, none of the client-side data is broken, however many
changes have taken place in TMW's client-side data. A future content-sync
with TMW may take place (though is not garunteed), but for that to happen
with minimal grunt-work, we need to ensure we use the same layout that they
do within our own data. To do that, I am making the following changes:

* Import graphics and client-side data for TMW's mobs and items
* Adjust data for LoF-specific items and mobs to fit TMW's new format
* Import new graphics from TMW.
* Import client-side map data from TMW that does not conflict with our map
  data. This does not garuntee that new TMW maps will appear in LoF.

If you are interested in helping, I go by the name Itchy Demon in LoF and
Piki on Freenode IRC. In addition, you may join #landoffire on Freenode to
discuss in real-time with other LoF contributors on what needs done.


Cheers!
